# Self Host Blocks

*Building blocks for self-hosting with battery included.*

SHB's (Self Host Blocks) goal is to provide a lower entry-bar for self-hosting. I intend to achieve
this by providing opinionated building blocks fitting together to self-host a wide range of
services. Also, the design will be extendable to allow users to add services not provided by SHB.

For each service, I intend to provide turn-key Nix options to setup:
- access through a subdomain,
- HTTPS access,
- backup,
- single sign-on,
- LDAP user management,
- and metrics and logs monitoring and alerting.

## Usage

The top-level `flake.nix` just outputs a nixos module that gathers all other modules from the [`modules/`](./modules/) directory.

Some provided modules are low-level and some are high-level that re-use those low-level ones. For
example, the nextcloud module re-uses the backup and nginx ones.

You want to use this repo as a flake input to your own repo. The `inputs` field of your `flake.nix`
file in your repo should look like so:

```nix
inputs = {
  nixpkgs.url = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  sops-nix.url = "github:Mic92/sops-nix";

  selfhostblocks.url = "github:ibizaman/selfhostblocks";
  selfhostblocks.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
  selfhostblocks.inputs.sops-nix.follows = "sops-nix";
};
```

`sops-nix` is used to setup passwords and secrets. Currently `selfhostblocks` has a strong
dependency on it but I'm working on removing that so you could use any secret provider.

The snippet above makes `selfhostblocks`' inputs follow yours. This is not maintainable though
because options that `selfhostblocks` rely on can change or disappear and you have no control on
that. Later, I intend to make `selfhostblocks` provide its own `nixpkgs` input and update it myself
through CI.

How you actually deploy using selfhostblocks depends on what system you choose. If you use
[colmena](https://colmena.cli.rs), this is what your `outputs` field could look like:

```nix
outputs = inputs@{ self, nixpkgs, ... }: {
  colmena = {
    meta = {
      nixpkgs = import inputs.nixpkgs {
        system = "x86_64-linux";
      };
      specialArgs = inputs;
    };

    myserver = import ./machines/myserver.nix;
  };
}
```

Now, what goes inside this `./machines/myserver.nix` file? First, import `selfhostblocks` and
`sops-nix`:

```nix
imports = [
  selfhostblocks.nixosModules.x86_64-linux.default
  sops-nix.nixosModules.default
]
```

For how to configure the services, check the sections below.

## Demos

Demos that start and deploy on a Virtual Machine on your computer are located under the
[demo](./demo/) folder. These show the onboarding experience you would get if you deployed
selfhostblocks on your own server.

## Examples

I plan to have documentation for all options provided by selfhostblocks and more examples. For now,
I have a few examples:

### Add SSL configuration

This is pretty much a prerequisite for all services.

```nix
shb.ssl = {
  enable = true;
  domain = "example.com";
  adminEmail = "me@example.com";
  sopsFile = ./secrets/linode.yaml;
  dnsProvider = "linode";
};
```

The configuration above assumes you own the `example.com` domain and the DNS is managed by Linode.

The `sops` file must be in the following format:

```yaml
acme: |-
    LINODE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=10
    LINODE_POLLING_INTERVAL=10
    LINODE_PROPAGATION_TIMEOUT=240
    LINODE_TOKEN=XYZ...
```

For now, linode is the only supported DNS provider as it's the one I'm using. I intend to make this
module more generic so you can easily use another provider not supported by `selfhostblocks`. You
can skip setting the `shb.ssl` options and roll your own. Feel free to look at the
[`ssl.nix`](./modules/ssl.nix) for inspiration.

### Add LDAP and Authelia services

These too are prerequisites for other services. Not all services support LDAP and SSO just yet, but
I'm working on that.

```nix
shb.ldap = {
  enable = true;
  domain = "example.com";
  subdomain = "ldap";
  ldapPort = 3890;
  httpPort = 17170;
  dcdomain = "dc=example,dc=com";
  sopsFile = ./secrets/ldap.yaml;
  localNetworkIPRange = "192.168.1.0/24";
};

shb.authelia = {
  enable = true;
  domain = "example.com";
  subdomain = "authelia";

  ldapEndpoint = "ldap://127.0.0.1:${builtins.toString config.shb.ldap.ldapPort}";
  dcdomain = config.shb.ldap.dcdomain;

  smtpHost = "smtp.mailgun.org";
  smtpPort = 587;
  smtpUsername = "postmaster@mg.example.com";

  secrets = {
    jwtSecretFile = config.sops.secrets."authelia/jwt_secret".path;
    ldapAdminPasswordFile = config.sops.secrets."authelia/ldap_admin_password".path;
    sessionSecretFile = config.sops.secrets."authelia/session_secret".path;
    notifierSMTPPasswordFile = config.sops.secrets."authelia/smtp_password".path;
    storageEncryptionKeyFile = config.sops.secrets."authelia/storage_encryption_key".path;
    identityProvidersOIDCHMACSecretFile = config.sops.secrets."authelia/hmac_secret".path;
    identityProvidersOIDCIssuerPrivateKeyFile = config.sops.secrets."authelia/private_key".path;
  };
};
sops.secrets."authelia/jwt_secret" = {
  sopsFile = ./secrets/authelia.yaml;
  mode = "0400";
  owner = config.shb.authelia.autheliaUser;
  restartUnits = [ "authelia.service" ];
};
sops.secrets."authelia/ldap_admin_password" = {
  sopsFile = ./secrets/authelia.yaml;
  mode = "0400";
  owner = config.shb.authelia.autheliaUser;
  restartUnits = [ "authelia.service" ];
};
sops.secrets."authelia/session_secret" = {
  sopsFile = ./secrets/authelia.yaml;
  mode = "0400";
  owner = config.shb.authelia.autheliaUser;
  restartUnits = [ "authelia.service" ];
};
sops.secrets."authelia/smtp_password" = {
  sopsFile = ./secrets/authelia.yaml;
  mode = "0400";
  owner = config.shb.authelia.autheliaUser;
  restartUnits = [ "authelia.service" ];
};
sops.secrets."authelia/storage_encryption_key" = {
  sopsFile = ./secrets/authelia.yaml;
  mode = "0400";
  owner = config.shb.authelia.autheliaUser;
  restartUnits = [ "authelia.service" ];
};
sops.secrets."authelia/hmac_secret" = {
  sopsFile = ./secrets/authelia.yaml;
  mode = "0400";
  owner = config.shb.authelia.autheliaUser;
  restartUnits = [ "authelia.service" ];
};
sops.secrets."authelia/private_key" = {
  sopsFile = ./secrets/authelia.yaml;
  mode = "0400";
  owner = config.shb.authelia.autheliaUser;
  restartUnits = [ "authelia.service" ];
};
```

This sets up [lldap](https://github.com/lldap/lldap) under `https://ldap.example.com` and [authelia](https://www.authelia.com/) under `https://authelia.example.com`.

The `lldap` sops file must be in the following format:

```yaml
lldap:
    user_password: XXX...
    jwt_secret: YYY...
```

You can format the `Authelia` sops file as you wish since you can give the path to every secret independently. For completeness, here's the format expected by the snippet above:

```yaml
authelia:
    ldap_admin_password: AAA...
    smtp_password: BBB...
    jwt_secret: CCC...
    storage_encryption_key: DDD...
    session_secret: EEE...
    storage_encryption_key: FFF...
    hmac_secret: GGG...
    private_key: |
        -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
        MII...MDQ=
        -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

Add backup to LDAP:

```nix
shb.backup.instances.lldap = {
  # Can also use "borgmatic".
  backend = "restic";

  keySopsFile = ./secrets/backup.yaml;

  # Backs up to 2 repositories.
  repositories = [
    "/srv/backup/restic/nextcloud"
    "s3:s3.us-west-000.backblazeb2.com/myserver-backup/nextcloud"
  ];

  retention = {
    keep_within = "1d";
    keep_hourly = 24;
    keep_daily = 7;
    keep_weekly = 4;
    keep_monthly = 6;
  };

  consistency = {
    repository = "2 weeks";
    archives = "1 month";
  };

  environmentFile = true;  # Needed for the s3 repository
}
```

This will backup the ldap users and groups to two different repositories. It assumes you have a
backblaze account.

The backup `sops` file format is:

```yaml
restic:
    passphrases:
        lldap: XYZ...
    environmentfiles:
        lldap: |-
            AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX...
            AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=YYY...
```

The AWS keys are those provided by Backblaze.

See the [`ldap.nix`](./modules/ldap.nix) and [`authelia.nix`](./modules/authelia.nix) modules for more info.

### Deploy the full Grafana, Prometheus and Loki suite

This is not a prerequisite for anything and could be enabled just for debugging.

```nix
shb.monitoring = {
  enable = true;
  subdomain = "grafana";
  inherit domain;
};
```

With that, Grafana, Prometheus, Loki and Promtail are setup! You can access `Grafana` at
`grafana.example.com`.

A few Prometheus metrics scrapers are setup automatically:
- node - cpu, memory, disk I/O, network I/O and a few others of the computer
- smartctl - hard drive health
- prometheus_internal - scraping jobs health
- nginx
- dnsmasq (if the service is enabled)

The following Loki logs scraper is setup automatically:
- systemd journal

I intend to provide more options so that you could for example tweak data retention.

Also, since all logs are now stored in Loki, you can probably reduce the systemd journal retention
time with:

```nix
# See https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/journald.conf.html#SystemMaxUse=
services.journald.extraConfig = ''
SystemMaxUse=2G
SystemKeepFree=4G
SystemMaxFileSize=100M
MaxFileSec=day
'';
```

### Deploy a Nextcloud Instance

```nix
shb.nextcloud = {
  enable = true;
  domain = "example.com";
  subdomain = "nextcloud";
  sopsFile = ./secrets/nextcloud.yaml;
  localNetworkIPRange = "192.168.1.0/24";
  debug = false;
};

# Only needed if you want to override some default settings.
services.nextcloud = {
  datadir = "/srv/nextcloud";
  poolSettings = {
    "pm" = "dynamic";
    "pm.max_children" = 120;
    "pm.start_servers" = 12;
    "pm.min_spare_servers" = 6;
    "pm.max_spare_servers" = 18;
  };
};

# Backup the Nextcloud data.
shb.backup.instances.nextcloud = # Same as for the Authelia one above;

# For onlyoffice
nixpkgs.config.allowUnfreePredicate = pkg: builtins.elem (pkgs.lib.getName pkg) [
  "corefonts"
];
```

The snippet above sets up:
- The nginx reverse proxy to listen on requests for the `nextcloud.example.com` domain.
- An onlyoffice instance listening at `oo.example.com` that only listens on the local
  nextwork; you still need to setup manually the onlyoffice plugin in Nextcloud.
- All the required databases and secrets.

The sops file format is:

```yaml
nextcloud:
    adminpass: XXX...
    onlyoffice:
        jwt_secret: YYY...
```

See the [`nextcloud-server.nix`](./modules/nextcloud-server.nix) module for more info.

You can enable tracing with:

```nix
shb.nextcloud.debug = true;
```

See [my blog post](http://blog.tiserbox.com/posts/2023-08-12-what%27s-up-with-nextcloud-webdav-slowness.html) for how to look at the traces.

### Enable verbose Nginx logging

In case you need more verbose logging to investigate an issue:

```nix
shb.nginx.accessLog = true;
shb.nginx.debugLog = true;
```

See the [`nginx.nix`](./modules/nginx.nix) module to see the effect of those options.

### Deploy an hledger Instance with LDAP and SSO support

```nix
shb.hledger = {
  enable = true;
  subdomain = "hledger";
  domain = "example.com";
  oidcEndpoint = "https://authelia.example.com";
  localNetworkIPRange = "192.168.1.0/24";
};
shb.backup.instances.hledger = # Same as the examples above
```

This will setup:
- The nginx reverse proxy to listen on requests for the `hledger.example.com` domain.
- Backup of everything.
- Only allow users of the `hledger_user` group to be able to login.
- All the required databases and secrets.

See [`hledger.nix`](./modules/hledger.nix) module for more details.

### Deploy a Jellyfin instance with LDAP and SSO support

```nix
shb.jellyfin = {
  enable = true;
  domain = "example.com";
  subdomain = "jellyfin";

  sopsFile = ./secrets/jellyfin.yaml;
  ldapHost = "127.0.0.1";
  ldapPort = 3890;
  dcdomain = config.shb.ldap.dcdomain;
  oidcEndpoint = "https://${config.shb.authelia.subdomain}.${config.shb.authelia.domain}";
  oidcClientID = "jellyfin";
  oidcUserGroup = "jellyfin_user";
  oidcAdminUserGroup = "jellyfin_admin";
};
shb.backup.instances.jellyfin = # Same as the examples above
```

This sets up, as usual:
- The nginx reverse proxy to listen on requests for the `jellyfin.example.com` domain.
- Backup of everything.
- Only allow users of the `jellyfin_user` or `jellyfin_admin` ldap group to be able to login.
- All the required databases and secrets.

The sops file format is:

```yaml
jellyfin:
    ldap_password: XXX...
    sso_secret: YYY...
```

Although the configuration of the [LDAP](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-plugin-ldapauth) and
[SSO](https://github.com/9p4/jellyfin-plugin-sso) plugins is done declaratively in the Jellyfin
`preStart` step, they still need to be installed manually at the moment.

See [`jellyfin.nix`](./modules/jellyfin.nix) module for more details.

### Deploy a Home Assistant instance with LDAP support

SSO support is WIP.

```nix
shb.home-assistant = {
  enable = true;
  subdomain = "ha";
  inherit domain;
  ldapEndpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:${builtins.toString config.shb.ldap.httpPort}";
  backupCfg = # Same as the examples above
  sopsFile = ./secrets/homeassistant.yaml;
};
services.home-assistant = {
  extraComponents = [
    "backup"
    "esphome"
    "jellyfin"
    "kodi"
    "wyoming"
    "zha"
  ];
};
services.wyoming.piper.servers = {
  "fr" = {
    enable = true;
    voice = "fr-siwis-medium";
    uri = "tcp://0.0.0.0:10200";
    speaker = 0;
  };
};
services.wyoming.faster-whisper.servers = {
  "tiny-fr" = {
    enable = true;
    model = "medium-int8";
    language = "fr";
    uri = "tcp://0.0.0.0:10300";
    device = "cpu";
  };
};
```

This sets up everything needed to have a Home Assistant instance available under `ha.example.com`.
It also shows how to have a `piper` and `whisper` server for respectively text to speech and speech
to text. The integrations must still be setup in the web UI.

The `sops` file must be in the following format:

```yaml
home-assistant: |
    country: "US"
    latitude_home: "0.01234567890123"
    longitude_home: "-0.01234567890123"
```

### Set up network tunnel with VPN and Proxy

```nix
shb.vpn.nordvpnus = {
  enable = true;
  # Only "nordvpn" supported for now.
  provider = "nordvpn";
  dev = "tun1";
  # Must be unique per VPN instance.
  routingNumber = 10;
  # Change to the one you want to connect to
  remoteServerIP = "1.2.3.4";
  sopsFile = ./secrets/vpn.yaml;
  proxyPort = 12000;
};
```

This sets up a tunnel interface `tun1` that connects to the VPN provider, here NordVPN. Also, if the
`proxyPort` option is not null, this will spin up a `tinyproxy` instance that listens on the given
port and redirects all traffic through that VPN.

```bash
$ curl 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json'
{"ip":"107.21.107.115"}

$ curl --interface tun1 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json'
{"ip":"46.12.123.113"}

$ curl --proxy 127.0.0.1:12000 'https://api.ipify.org?format=json'
{"ip":"46.12.123.113"}
```

## Tips

### Run tests

```bash
$ nix flake check
```

### Deploy using colmena

```bash
$ nix run nixpkgs#colmena -- apply
```

### Use a local version of selfhostblocks

This works with any flake input you have. Either, change the `.url` field directly in you `flake.nix`:

```nix
selfhostblocks.url = "/home/me/projects/selfhostblocks";
```

Or override on the command line:

```bash
$ nix run nixpkgs#colmena --override-input selfhostblocks ../selfhostblocks -- apply
```

### Diff changes

First, you must know what to compare. You need to know the path to the nix store of what is already deployed and to what you will deploy.

#### What is deployed

To know what is deployed, either just stash the changes you made and run `build`:

```bash
$ nix run nixpkgs#colmena -- build
...
Built "/nix/store/yyw9rgn8v5jrn4657vwpg01ydq0hazgx-nixos-system-baryum-23.11pre-git"
```

Or ask the target machine:

```bash
$ nix run nixpkgs#colmena -- exec -v readlink -f /run/current-system
baryum | /nix/store/77n1hwhgmr9z0x3gs8z2g6cfx8gkr4nm-nixos-system-baryum-23.11pre-git
```

#### What will get deployed

Assuming you made some changes, then instead of deploying with `apply`, just `build`:

```bash
$ nix run nixpkgs#colmena -- build
...
Built "/nix/store/16n1klx5cxkjpqhrdf0k12npx3vn5042-nixos-system-baryum-23.11pre-git"
```

#### Get the full diff

With `nix-diff`:

```
$ nix run nixpkgs#nix-diff -- \
  /nix/store/yyw9rgn8v5jrn4657vwpg01ydq0hazgx-nixos-system-baryum-23.11pre-git \
  /nix/store/16n1klx5cxkjpqhrdf0k12npx3vn5042-nixos-system-baryum-23.11pre-git \
  --color always | less
```

#### Get version bumps

A nice summary of version changes can be produced with:

```bash
$ nix run nixpkgs#nvd -- diff \
  /nix/store/yyw9rgn8v5jrn4657vwpg01ydq0hazgx-nixos-system-baryum-23.11pre-git \
  /nix/store/16n1klx5cxkjpqhrdf0k12npx3vn5042-nixos-system-baryum-23.11pre-git \
```

### Generate random secret

```bash
$ nix run nixpkgs#openssl -- rand -hex 64
```
