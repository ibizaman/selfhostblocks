      Contract for database backup between a requester module
      and a provider module.

      The requester communicates to the provider
      how to backup the database
      through the `request` options.

      The provider reads from the `request` options
      and backs up the database as requested.
      It communicates to the requester what script is used
      to backup and restore the database
      through the `result` options.
