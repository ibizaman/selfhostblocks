Self Host Blocks intends to help you self host any service you would like with best practices out of
the box.

To achieve this, Self Host Blocks provides building blocks which each provide part of what a self
hosted app should do (SSO, HTTPS, etc.). It also provides some services that are already integrated
with all those building blocks.

- You are new to self hosting and want pre-configured services to deploy easily. Look at the
  [services section](services.html).
- You are a seasoned self-hoster but want to enhance some services you deploy already. Go to the
  [blocks section](blocks.html).
- You are a user of Self Host Blocks but would like to use your own implementation for a block. Head
  over to the [matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#selfhostblocks:matrix.org) (the manual for this
  is WIP).
