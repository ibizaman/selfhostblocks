# Services {#services}

Services are usually web applications that SHB help you self-host. Configuration of those is
purposely made opinionated and require as few nix options as can make sense. That is possible thanks to the extensive use of blocks provided by SHB.

::: {.note}
Not all services are yet documented. You can find all available services [in the repository](@REPO@/modules/services).

The following table summarizes for each documented service what features it provides. More
information is provided in the respective manual sections.
